# NextJS tutorial with Typescript

Here is a Typescript implementation of the following NextJS tutorial: [https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)

I am sharing this repository with you because I wanted to learn NextJS by using and learning Typescript at the same time and I encountered some difficulties.

For example, to use eslint for .ts and .tsx files, it requires some specific configuration that you can find in `.eslintrc.js` 
You may also check my `tsconfig.json` if you're new to Typescript, I tried to configure it as strict as possible to be very rigourous when writing code.

Also, since with Typescript you have to define every type (I set `<any>` not to work), there are some weird types to discover so it might save you some time.

Feel free to dm me on Twitter if you have any questions!
